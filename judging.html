<h3>Judging Categories
</h3>
<p>     Hacks should be customer focused, improving their experience with Shutterstock as a seller or buyer. Hacks will judged broadly across our business units: 
</p>
     <ul>
      <li>eCommerce Image</li>
      <li>eCommerce Motion</li>
      <li>Enterprise</li>
      <li>Editorial</li>
      <li>Webdam</li>
      <li>Flashstock</li>
      <li>We'll also have a special category this year for <i>The Ultimate Plugin</i>! By utilizing our Shutterstock APIs, we aim to drive product innovation outside the norm. In this category we are focused on extensibility: Wordpress Plugins, Extensions, or App gadgets/widgets - the tools that enable shortcuts in the creative lifecycle.</li>
    
     </ul>

<p>Each submission is only eligible to win in one category. All hacks will be considered for The Ultimate Plugin category. Note: judges may move hacks to a different category they feel is more appropriate.</p>

<p>After Hack demos finish on Friday, August 11, judges will deliberate and then announce the winners via live stream the same day.</p>
     
<h3>Prizes:</h3>
<p>The winning teams will receive a prize (details TBD) and their hack/pitch will be considered for a sprint in 2017-18.
